                <h3>September 2023</h3>
                <p>This is my first website and project that I publicly uploaded.</p>
                <p>During that period I already learned C++ and started my programming journey. that's why I created this resume website to showcase my skills.</p>
                <p>I made that website using Deus Ex: Human Revolution theme black gold which became my primary theme for almost all of my website</p>
                <p>I use that website to share people my skills and qualifications. people can view and download the PDF of my resume as well</p>

                <h2><a href="https://github.com/taaheer/QPad">Qpad</a> (abandoned)</h2>
                <h3>January 2024</h3>
                <p>QPad is a simple text editor created using Qt Widgets.</p>
                <p>after learning Qt framework, I attempted to create notepad. It turned out to be good like actual Windows 10 notepad with all similar features of it.</p>
                <p>But after that I never touch that code again and probably not will again which is why its label as abandoned.</p>
                <p>In future, after learning QML, I might recreate Qpad and add features that I want and also make it cross platform.</p>

                <h2><a href="index.html">Homepage</a></h2>
                <h3>January 2024</h3>
                <p>Nothing, just a homepage to help people navigate to other pages on my website.</p>
            </section>
            <section id="fourth">
                <h2><a href="actor.html">Actor Portfolio</a></h2>
                <h3>March 2024</h3>
                <p>After getting the chance to act on camera for first time, I decided to be an actor as well.</p>
                <p>Design of this is different from my primary black gold theme.</p>
                <p>This is the first website where I added dark mode and light mode.</p>

            <section id="fifth">
                <h2><a href="projects.html">Projects</a></h2>
                <h3>May 2024</h3>
                <p>Initially I thought that I would use homepage to list all my projects but it wasn't a great idea so I made this projects page where I will list all my projects as timeline in chronological order.</p>
